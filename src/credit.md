The font is `Catamaran`, designed by Dr. Pria Ravichandran. You can find more of her work on [the foundry5 website](https://foundryfivetype.com/), or the [Catamaran font itself on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Catamaran).

The colour palette used throughout the website is "Mocha" from the Catppuccin Theme. Check it out at [catppuccin.com]( https://catppuccin.com/).

The background is called "Evening Sky" and - as far as I know - is created by Gingeh. You can find her on Mastodon at [@Gingeh@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@Gingeh). The wallpaper can be found in the following repository: [github.com/Gingeh/wallpapers](https://github.com/Gingeh/wallpapers).
