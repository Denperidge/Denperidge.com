tagline: A regular website should run on older and slower devices too, you know.

## The problem
1. High-level programming and frameworks are a beauty. We've been able to make faster and more beautiful technology.
2. And then someone decided that PHP should be used for a page that could be a static website.
3. And then someone said that 3 ads and a video should outplay on mobile.
4. And actually why are you using that phone we stopped giving it updates a year after its release and the parts also don't exist anymore sorry.

## Unproblemming
Care! CARE! Care for devices and the people that use them! Develop with slower devices in mind. Develop user-first.
