## Problem
A lot of accessibility mistakes make it through production:
- Try navigating your computer or a random website using only your keyboard. Notice how plenty of websites make this impossible.
- Open your social media of choice, and check how many images on it have an alt text. Realise that a lack of proper sight means you can't see nor experience the occasional essential content.
- Take note of the small size of some buttons or links. Realise that with a hand with tremors/shakes, it might be a *lot* harder to click it.

There's a lot of people out there. Some can't use their hands well. Some have bad vision.
You might be one of them. Maybe not.
Either way, no matter what disability, you should be able to enjoy the world the same as everyone.


## Non-problemming
 And I mean, I'm not free of goofs in terms of accessibility! I'm definitely not an A+ student on this. But do make sure that you try. The [W3Schools accessibility tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/accessibility/) is pretty good in my personal opinion, but if you have any others that have helped you, please feel free to reach out!
