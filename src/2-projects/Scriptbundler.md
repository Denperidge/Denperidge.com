# Scriptbundler
With a large scale script project, it's a lot easier during development to split it up into multiple files. Then you can easily insert those into large and/or packaged applications. But when your application is the script, requiring the end user to download a whole directory full of them would be very non-user-friendly, while developing in one gigantic script could make development a lot harder. This project is meant as a possible solution for this.

## Achievements
- It worked!


## Future improvements
- But only in very basic usage! It would require much more testing to be any sense of robust.
