# Semantic.works documentation rework
Some key members of my past employer (redpencil.io) manage the semantic.works microservice stack. Which is cool! But onboarding on it took a second and a half. Key information was locked behind Masterclass videos on a private google drive or sometimes full on documented nowhere. Over multiple months, I worked together with the maintainers to find the ideal way to write, collect, parse & display the documentation.

## Achievements
- A focus on user-friendliness for writer & reader served it well
- Old documentation was adopted to the new style
- This allowed for versioned documentation


## Future improvements
- It's still in its early stages, so the stability could be better
