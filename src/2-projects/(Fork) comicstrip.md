  "description": "A fork of a fork of comicstrip, allowing in-code usage of the previously CLI-only program",
  "intro": "Comicstrip is a very neat program. It cuts up a comic page into different panes! However, the original only allows for Python2 usage. And while the fork fixes that, it still lacks the ability to be used as anything but a command line tool. What if someone created exports that allowed for using comicstrip in a different program?",
  "achievements": "- Fork of a fork! Build on existing solutions, don't reinvent the wheel where not needed.\n- It works! A previously CLI-only tool, now a tool for both coding & CLI usage.\n- Added a proper entry in the changelog file\n",
  "future_improvements": "- I didn't do a full release on pypi\n- The README could have done with more updates due to the restructuring\n",
