title: Just Give Me The Audio
description: A fully script-based, minimal audio/video downloader

intro:
    A minimal nonsense youtube downloader. Simply copy the youtube link to your clipboard and run mp3.bat, or wav.bat, or whatever file that your heart desires.
    No dependencies or extra setup necessary; a one-click install automatically downloads the latest yt-dlp & ffmpeg version, and you're good to go.

good_things:
  - One-click install which automatically grabs the latest version of the binaries
  - Its fully script based, no binary files within the code
  - You can rename mp3.bat to wav.bat, and it will then download a wav instead. Come on. That's pretty neat
  - Its faster than a GUI as well as the CLI!

bad_things:
  - It only supports Windows
  - The script windows pop up and remove fast, which may look a bit weird
