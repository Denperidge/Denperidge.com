intro:
    The Jackbox party pack games have the unique feature of anyone's phone being easily
    and quickly useable as a controller for their games. But what if you could have that
    functionality for nearly every controller supported game?

good_things:
  - Only an install on the Windows PC, but none on the phones!
  - It worked!
  - Thanks to the external driver library used, it popped up like a regular Xbox360 controller.

bad_things:
  - Only works on Windows
  - Due to being on a touch screen, there are some limitations to weird simultaneous button inputs
  - No README
