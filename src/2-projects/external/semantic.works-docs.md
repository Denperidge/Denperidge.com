title: Semantic.works documentation rework
description: My efforts to rework an entire tech stacks documentation
tags:
  - external
  - documentation

intro:
    Some key members of my past employer (redpencil.io) manage the semantic.works microservice stack.
    Which is cool! But onboarding on it took a second and a half. Key information was locked behind
    Masterclass videos on a private google drive or sometimes full on documented nowhere. Over multiple months,
    I worked together with the maintainers to find the ideal way to write, collect, parse & display the documentation.

good_things:
  - A focus on user-friendliness for writer & reader served it well 
  - Old documentation was adopted to the new style
  - This allowed for versioned documentation

bad_things:
  - It's still in its early stages, so the stability could be better
