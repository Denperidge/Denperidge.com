description: A script to create a bunch of pride emojis
tags:
  - queer
  - python

intro:
    The pronouns.page website has a curated selection of flags.
    I want emojis of them. I don't want to manually do that for every single one though.
    So let's use a Python script!

hrefs:
    - name: pride-emoji-generator
      url: https://github.com/Denperidge/pride-emoji-generator

good_things:
  - Uses PIL and svg shapes to create a bunch of transparent emojis
  - GitHub Releases for easy downloads

bad_things:
  - Could do with a web interface
  - GitHub Releases are done manually
