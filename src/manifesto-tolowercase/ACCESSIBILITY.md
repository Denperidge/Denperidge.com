## The who
> People with hand tremors/not able to grip a mouse --> Keyboard navigation
> People with mobility disabilities --> Voice control, eye tracking, switch devices
> People who are blind --> Screen readers, braille displays, speech recognition
> People with low vision --> Screen magnification

## The what
- Try navigating your computer or a random website using only your keyboard. Notice how plenty of websites make this impossible.
- Open your social media of choice, and check how many images on it have an alt text. Realise that a lack of proper sight means you can't see any of that.
- Take note of the small size of some buttons or links.

## The how
A lot of accessibility mistakes make it through. And I mean, same! I'm definitely not an A+ student on this. But do make sure that you try. The [W3Schools accessibility tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/accessibility/) is pretty good in my personal opinion, but if you have any others that have helped you, please feel free to reach out!
