## Anti CSS frameworks
Frameworks are great: they're community-tested, well mantained and designed, and can be a huge timesaver. But as the [example on the bottom of the PicoCSS website](https://picocss.com/#why) examplifies, there is an increasing problem of unmaintainable HTML that's written in function of a single framework. Getting to create beautiful custom designs, and having the HTML and CSS grow together, is underappreciated. 

## Creativity
In an industry ruled by big budgets and safe decisions, I'd like to add to the weird stuff. The times of useless gifs and easter eggs, revealmore messages to cheer up someones day, customisable profiles, app themes. Self expression deserves a place in tech.
