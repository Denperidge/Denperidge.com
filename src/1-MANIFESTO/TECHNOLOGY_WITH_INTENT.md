## Politics
Politics are shaped by the world and the world shapes politics. [We're all technological little cyborgs at this point](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx1KJaeIa-SFLEnTg-xRhtEwh4xi2NC3aA).

- [Meta profited of interference with the 2016 elections](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54722362)
- [An npm package was used to wipe Russian servers after the Ukraine war broke out](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/sabotage-code-added-to-popular-npm-package-wiped-files-in-russia-and-belarus/)
- [Many platforms have found a niche for themselves by hosting hateful content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-tech)
- [These platforms had a direct hand in a conspiracy-fueled attack on january 6th](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/17/jan6-committee-report-social-media/)
- [American police use real gamified recordings to train officers](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/7/21293259/police-racism-violence-ideology-george-floyd)

I'm not versed well enough in the sociology nor philosophy to argue on whether these platforms or conditions should have ever existed in the first place. There's no direct methods to go about it outlined in this manifesto page. All I can say is that you should develop for the best of humanity in mind, and that I hope our visions for the future align a bit.
