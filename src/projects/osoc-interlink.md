description: Transforming the public participant data from OSOC into an interlinked navigation

intro:
    All the Open Summer Of Code data is open (as is fitting), 
    but there's no way to view all the projects a person has worked on.
    So some work later, here it is!

hrefs:
    - name: osoc-interlink
      url: https://github.com/Denperidge/osoc-interlink
    - url: https://denperidge.com/osoc-interlink/

good_things:
  - It's fun to navigate through!
  - Manual patches due to small data inconsistencies are accounted for 

bad_things:
  - The styling is a bit basic
