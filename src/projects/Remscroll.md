# Remscroll
A friend was going down a list, which required clicking a load more button. So some code later, they could press a button to save their position, and automatically click the required button when opening the site up again!

## Achievements
- Albeit basic, there's some design. I kind of still like the icon.
- It worked!


## Future improvements
- Unmaintained, it might require some reworking for modern browsers
- Old design & codebase
