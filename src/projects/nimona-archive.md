intro:
  The Nimona webcomic has spawned a fully printed version, a movie, and helped start the career of its author!
  This project aims to provide an archive for the orignal release and create a more accessible form of reading the comic.

good_things:
  - Using Comicstrip
  - Although a work in progress, alt text is being added for every panel
  - Patches have been created to (for example) remove the authors deadname
  - It's a nice archive for the original release, which includes little authors notes

bad_things:
  - The styling of the website still requires some work
