# [Projects/](..) Terraria Raspbian Server
You can run a Terraria server on your Raspberry Pi, but it requires some manual setups and changes. What if you didn't have to do any of that?

## Achievements
- Interactive setup through a single Bash script
- Included systemd files for auto-launch *and* auto-save
- Puts away the server files neatly into a dedicated folder
- Relatively readable bash script (if I may say so myself)
- Updating the script for newer versions should only require one line to be changed
- A README including specific considerations, e.g. swapfile, port forwarding...


## Future improvements
- Updating the script for newer versions *shouldn't* require one line to be changed, but 0 lines. It'd be nice to make it automatically download the latest version.
