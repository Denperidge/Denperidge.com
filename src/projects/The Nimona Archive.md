# The Nimona Archive
The Nimona webcomic has spawned a fully printed version, a movie, and helped start the career of its author! This project aims to provide an archive for the orignal webcomic release, alongside creating a more accessible form of reading the comic.

## Achievements
- Using Comicstrip
- Although a work in progress, alt text is being added for every panel
- Patches have been created to (for example) make filenames more consistent, remove the authors deadname
- It's a nice archive for the original release, which includes little authors notes

## Future improvements
- The styling of the website still requires some work
