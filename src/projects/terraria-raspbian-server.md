title: Terraria Raspbian Server
description: Setup a Terraria server on Raspbian/Linux with just one script, including autosave!

tags:
    - Bash
    - Videos game

intro: 
    You can run a Terraria server on your Raspberry Pi, but it requires some manual setups and changes. What if you didn't have to do any of that?

achievements:
    - Interactive setup through a single Bash script
    - Included systemd files for auto-launch AND auto-save
    - Puts away the server files neatly into a dedicated folder
    - Relatively readable bash script, if I may say so myself
    - Updating the script for newer versions should only require one line to be changed
    - A README including specific considerations, e.g. swapfile, port forwarding...
