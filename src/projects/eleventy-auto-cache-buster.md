- It just works! No-maintenance content hashes. It's great.
- Some simple tests ensure the base functionality works over updates
- It runs on the website you're currently reading this on! Check it out in inspect element or [the websites repo](https://github.com

## Future improvements
- The current testing is quite rudimentary, lacking more filetypes as well as some configuration parameters
