# Comicstrip
Comicstrip is a very neat program. It cuts up a comic page into different panes! However, the original only allows for Python2 usage. And while the fork fixes that, it still lacks the ability to be used as anything but a command line tool. What if someone created exports that allowed for using comicstrip in a different program?

## Achievements
- Fork of a fork! Build on existing solutions, don't reinvent the wheel where not needed.
- It works! A previously CLI-only tool, now a tool for both coding & CLI usage.
- Added a proper entry in the changelog file


## Future improvements
- I didn't do a full release on pypi
- The README/repository could have done with more updates due to the restructuring
