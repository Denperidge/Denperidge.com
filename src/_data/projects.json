It cuts up a comic page into different panes! However, the original only allows for Python2 usage. And while the fork fixes that, it still lacks the ability to be used as anything but a command line tool. What if someone created exports that allowed for using comicstrip in a different program?","achievements":"- Fork of a fork! Build on existing solutions, don't reinvent the wheel where not needed.\n- It works! A previously CLI-only tool, now a tool for both coding & CLI usage.\n- Added a proper entry in the changelog file\n","future_improvements":"- I didn't do a full release on pypi\n- The README could have done with more updates due to the restructuring\n","path":"comicstrip"},{"id":76,"sort":null,"tags":["Scripting","Batch","GitHub","PowerShell"],"title":"Just Give Me The Audio","hrefs":[{"name":"just-give-me-the-audio","url":"https://github.com/Denperidge/just-give-me-the-audio"}],"description":"A fully script-based, minimal audio/video downloader","intro":"A minimal nonsense youtube downloader. Simply copy the youtube link to your clipboard and run mp3.bat, or wav.bat, or whatever file that your heart desires. No dependencies or extra setup necessary; a one-click install automatically downloads the latest yt-dlp & ffmpeg version, and you're good to go.","achievements":"- One-click install which automatically grabs the latest version of the binaries\n- Its fully script based, no binary files within the code\n- You can rename mp3.bat to wav.bat, and it will then download a wav instead. Come on. That's pretty neat\n- Its faster than a GUI as well as the CLI!\n","future_improvements":"- It only supports Windows\n- The script windows pop up and remove fast, which may look a bit weird\n","path":"just-give-me-the-audio"},{"id":79,"sort":null,"tags":["Neonpastel","Python","GitHub","CI","Build Tools","Parcel","Pug","HTML","SCSS","CSS","JavaScript","Image Editing"],"title":"The Nimona Archive","hrefs":[{"name":"Nimona Archive","url":"https://github.com/Denperidge/Nimona-Archive"},{"name":"Nimona Archive Patcher","url":"https://github.com/Denperidge/Nimona-Archive-Patcher"}],"description":"An archive for the Nimona webcomic, with extra accessibility & style!","intro":"The Nimona webcomic has spawned a fully printed version, a movie, and helped start the career of its author!
