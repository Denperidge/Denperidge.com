    Now, this is already a doozy. Get ready for me being sappy.
    I have not been able to watch OK K.O. season 1 episode 7 "I am Dendy" without crying.
    Seeing this little nerdy kid viewing everything through the lense of code & data,
    doing their best to help those - and understanding the world  - around them?
    Tears. At least from me. Maybe not from you.

    Testing to see if things are possible for the sake of their possibility or interest.
    Adoring tech a bit too much. But that's okay. Look at her go!

    appreciate the beauty and intricacies of trees, life, and nature. Something that we all oughta do.
    Me included.
